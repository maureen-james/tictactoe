# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game in Python. Two players, "X" and "O", take turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe.py
